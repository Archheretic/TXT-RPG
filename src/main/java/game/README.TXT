The entry point in this program is running the main method of Game.java 


This project is ment to become a text based RPG. I want to have a good framework before I start implementing content.
Hopefully I won't tire of this project before atleast the framework is finished.

This project was in start made on the framework of the project World of Zhuul on chapter 6 in the book "Objects first with Java".
I don't think theres any code left from Zhuul expect perhaps a few variable names, but it was the project that inspired me to make a txt rpg.

Later on some of the programming logic has also been influenced by lever-oblig3, made by Even AAby Larsen, especially the Command-system and the "world package".

The Attribute system has been inspired by http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-the-d-for-an-rpg-attributes-system--gamedev-243
And the EnemyFactory system by http://www.newthinktank.com/2012/09/factory-design-pattern-tutorial/


TOP PRIOTITY:

Refactoring the Character class and Game class.
The Character class contains tons of logic that perhaps should be put into the respective command
classes. The end goal for the Character class should perhaps be close to a character sheet with a few extra methods.

Fix the decription on items to become more dynamyc
fix the description on spells and magic so it becomes more dynamic.
